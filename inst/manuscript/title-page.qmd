title: "The Impact of Mental Images on Reasoning: A Study on Aphantasia"
abstract: "There is a long-standing debate about the role of visual mental 
  images in reasoning. Knauff and Johnson-Laird's (2002) Visual Imagery 
  Impedance Hypothesis (VIIH) suggests visual imagery can hinder abstract 
  reasoning, as evidenced by slower responses to visual compared to spatial 
  and control problems. Aphantasia — reduced or absent visual imagery— offers 
  a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis. In an online version of the 
  reasoning paradigm used in VIIH studies, aphantasic and control participants 
  completed three problem types (visual, spatial, control), while reaction time 
  and accuracy scores were measured. In addition, a second classification, based 
  on the Object-Spatial Imagery and Verbal Questionnaire (OSIVQ), was employed 
  to differentiate participants according to their cognitive style and explore 
  possible performance differences between the visualiser, spatialiser and 
  verbaliser clusters. Our study replicated the findings of Knauff and 
  Johnson-Laird (2002), as a slowdown for visual problems in comparison to 
  spatial and control ones was demonstrated in typical imagers. In aphantasics, 
  this effect was less marked, but the difference between the groups is not
  substantial enough to be conclusively established. More in-depth analyses 
  distinguishing “complete aphantasia” and hypophantasia revealed a more 
  significant slowdown within the latter group, suggesting that visual imagery, 
  even in its weakest form, influences performance on such tasks. Finally, our 
  OSIVQ classification-based analyses showed that participants in the visualiser 
  cluster are the most impaired in this task. Overall, our results demonstrated 
  the importance of considering the influence of mental images and cognitive 
  styles in theories of reasoning."
