Tout ce qui concerne les groupes viendra après

We compared a group of self-identified aphantasic individuals with a control
group of individuals with self-reported intact visual imagery.

All completed an online version of the French Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire
(VVIQ-F, \cite{santarpiaEvaluerVivaciteImages2008}; Santarpia et al., 2008;
adapted from \cite{marksVisualImageryDifferences1973}).

Furthermore, in line with the methodology employed in a study that administered
the OSIVQ to an aphantasic population \citep{delemcognitiveprofilesinaphantasia2025},
unsupervised clustering analysis was employed, whose methodology is detailed below.
This data-driven, machine-learning method produced the second classification used
in this study. Three clusters were identified, each characterized by a cognitive
style defined by the three-dimensional OSIVQ model. The first cluster scored
higher on the imagery-object dimension than on the other two dimensions, the
second cluster scored higher on the imagery-spatial dimension, and the third
cluster scored higher on the verbal dimension. In the remainder of this work,
these three groups will be referred to respectively as the visualizer cluster
(formed of NN non-aphantasics), the spatializer cluster (formed of NN aphantasics
and NN non-aphantasics) and the verbalizer cluster (formed of NN aphantasics and
NN non-aphantasics). For this second classification, the total number of
participants was NN, as two participants did not complete the OSIVQ.
