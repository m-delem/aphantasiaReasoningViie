I think I could create less data frames than in the previous DLC version. This
one had:

- df_zero: the central data frame with:
  -> the clusters created with OSIVQ

- df_osivq: df_zero reduced to one line per ID to perform clustering
  -> this could be replaced by doing the clustering on filtered_survey_data

- cluster_osivq_data & add_cluster_column: I need a more robust way of deciding
  which clustering to use and how to name the resulting clusters
  -> function to plot the clusters + describe again? Decide based on that
  -> function where I specify explicitly which names I want for clusters 1/2/3
     etc.

- df_acc doesnt seem necessary, unless the additional columns are used for
  plotting

- df_rt adds the filtering of outlier RT trials
  -> design a distribution plotting function too?

- df_rt_long: need a function - get_longer_terms on filtered_expe_data

- df_strats: simply factor_strategies on filtered_survey_data

- df_strats_long: function get_longer_strats on filtered_survey_data

- Better describe_sample function

- When to add the factoring functions?
-> factor_groups
-> factor_categories
-> factor_strategies
-> add factor_clusters too?
