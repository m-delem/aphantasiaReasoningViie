- cluster_osivq_data & add_cluster_column: I need a more robust way of deciding
  which clustering to use and how to name the resulting clusters
  -> function to plot the clusters + describe again? Decide based on that
  -> function where I specify explicitly which names I want for clusters 1/2/3
     etc.
