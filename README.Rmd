aphantasiaReasoningViie is a data analysis project disguised as an R
package. It contains the code and data to reproduce the analyses presented in the paper "*The Impact of Mental Images on Reasoning: A Study on Aphantasia*".

The R package structure was chosen to facilitate the sharing of the code and 
data with the scientific community, and to make it easy to reproduce the 
analyses. It is not intended to be a general-purpose package, but rather a
collection of functions and data specific to this study (although many functions
are reusable in their own right). The package development workflow (see
[this reference book](https://r-pkgs.org/)) is also a good way to ensure that 
the code is well-documented and tested, which is important for reproducibility 
in scientific research.

## Installation

The code to install the development version of aphantasiaReasoningViie is the
following:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("m-delem/aphantasiaReasoningViie")
```

Note that the current WIP version of the package is private, so this might be
unstable. Cloning the repository to work on it is the way to go for now. Once
you have cloned the repository, launch the R project in RStudio by opening the
`aphantasiaReasoningViie.Rproj` file and run the following command:

```{r}
devtools::load_all()
```

... Which will load the package and make all its functions and data available in
your R session.
